Qs and As for the LDSA data science prep course 2020

## Why?

Because slack sucks and is expensive for anything that should last more than 1 day.

## What?

This is where all questions that might be useful to more than 1 person should be asked, discussed, and answered. In this way, we maintain a structured, searchable, taggable, long-living, and publicly available repository of knowledge.

## How?

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-forum/issues)
1. Tag the issue with the appropriate tags
1. Ask your question in as much details, using screenshots, stack-traces, etc. as possible
1. Submit the issue
1. Watch the #forum channel in slack for notifications for when issues are created / commented on
